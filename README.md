# GPU Flow

GPU Flow is a customizable Rainmeter skin that visualizes your GPU's performance in real-time. It displays current and historical GPU usage and temperature using sleek line graphs and text, alongside the current average clock speed. The skin integrates with MSI Afterburner for temperature, clock speed data, and GPU usage metrics.
